    <h4>High Mysticism by Emma Curtis Hopkins</h4>
    <p>Context</p>
    <p>So emma is also rather teacher of teachers; am intrigued by works born of the new thought movement, her writings give a different perspective on things, I intend to explore the character of jesus from her point of view, Jesus appears in many books outside the bible even in occult books, so I hope perhaps to see it from an outside inside perspective.</p>
<blockquote>Quote. "Wheresoever thou finds thy self, drop that self” </blockquote>
<h4>Self recognition</h4>
<p>the Self recognition that Jesus practiced, His leadership in Self recognition was His credential to special acknowledgment and special praise on the part of all mankind, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me" should be the Jacob cry of all the world, "Why 0 man will ye die, having power to partake of the breath of immortality?</p>
<h4>to see</h4>
<p>Mankind yearns for a country and a comradeship he cannot find except by enduring as seeing toward that city which hath no need of the sun or the moon to lighten it, for his own Beloved is the light thereof.
    "the concepts of future creations are present in their completeness in the eternal Now before being brought to birth in the material sphere
    </p>
    <h4>The look, yeah that look.</h4>
    <p>"And he brought him (Abram) forth abroad and said, look now toward heaven, and I will give thee a son of her (Sarai) and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her. “The finished kingdom, the "Archetypal World" is forever wooing the sons of men to look toward it that they may find themselves and their environments blessed with supernal newness.</p>
<span>We see that looking specifically again when God sends poisonous serpent forth in the wilderness as Moses moves his people, a brass serpent statue is raised up and anyone that looked up to it was saved, hmmmm so the serpent in this case was raised above all for the world to look toward and be saved, reminds of carl jung’s man and his symbols, perhaps that’s why “poisoned” or rebels are saved by the truth bringing trickster at the crossroads, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: </span>
<p>Thus sayeth the Lord of hosts, Turn unto me, saith the Lord of hosts and I will turn unto you, saith the Lord of hosts." </p>
<p>Among other mentions of visible things appearing from invisibles with tangible outcomes, because of sighting/looking toward. 'Lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created," said the heavenly voice to Isaiah. "Wheresoever thou lookest there I am."</p>
<span>This takes me to jesus teaching manifestation in book of mark, providing three keys, 1. Faith, or hope or tunnel vision perhaps the look. 2. Don’t believe, become it without doubt, 3.forgive the other, basically remove or lessen your burden or perhaps negativity. </span>
<p>"I believe hardships fall away of their own weight," in place of, "I am in bondage to hardships.
    I cannot cure myself." Nobody is asked to cure himself of his particular bondage. He is asked to look up to him who redeemeth the life from destruction, taking off every load. To him whose only order has been, "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth
    </p>
<h4>Looking up to meditation</h4>
<p>"Become relaxed," say certain Brahmins among us. "Drop sights and sounds; drop thoughts; drop emotions; become blank for a few seconds; then allow one positive thought to take possession. Hold the thought firmly. It will demonstrate in time in outward conditions." This is their way of letting go, rejecting, on behalf of a thought. There is One above thought, above being, wrote the Seers of old Kabbalah philosophy. "It is infinite (perhaps the alpha and omega or the good and bad or the candle flame splitting wave)," they said. "Take no thought," said Jesus. "Look up to the fields white for the harvest." </p>
    <h4>persistence and perseverance</h4>
    <p>The executiveness of persistence, perseverance. Seek ye my face ofttime evermore. "Persistence of vision, By persistent attention toward the Divinity Self, “Attention is the secret of success.”, the Ageless Son of God, Plato found that "nothing can injure the immortal principle of the Soul."  </p>
    <span>The observer of my mind. </span>
    <p>Have we not been told with the distinctness of trip hammers hitting bell rims that the True Self, the Son of the Highest is joyous, strong, and imperishable? The "I" can say anything it chooses about itself. </p>
    <h4>trinity vs duality, transfiguration vs transcendence</h4>
    <p>The Trinity. "I and the Father are one." "The Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name, shall teach you all things."</p>
    <span>So Yahweh is commonly associated with duality, for example he cannot be seen as evil or malicious, though seen as jealous sometimes, </span>
    <p>"Behold the beauty of the Lord," sang King David. "Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works," sang Ezra</p>
    <p>The waters drown, the winds devastate, the plants poison," we are told. But it’s not in themselves to be so. Have they not all been pronounced good from the genesis? </p>
    <span> perhaps yaweh is just too dangerous for man for him to reveal himself he has to conceal himself from man</span>
    <br><span>, he has the devil to be his  “bad” side,hence the relevance of the church due to perseverance of the evil., and we see this principal of duality in the ark of noah, male and female, light and darkness, till jesus comes to surpass this, being seen as a good person among the “bad” and “bad” among the good, emperor nero killed so many Christian because these Christians keep creating confusion among the religion-income based rome, abraxas an occult god solves this by being both good and evil, a two-faced coin as it is among some African traditional religions, wholeness among some,yin and yang or perhaps you walk the middle line like jesus or flow like wu wei, if you erase your demons through things like character development or assasination then perhaps you erase oneself.</span>
    <p>William Blake, the poet, in his subjective or inward viewings, revelled in the hells as essentials of God ; but when he outwardly beheld the suffering children, he flamed with anger. He could not bear these real superficial views of his own hidden interpretions. He forgot his doctrine that hells are essentials</p>
    <p>"If any man will come after me let him deny himself, and take his cross" (the practice of denial of all that is not For God). </p>
    <span>So jesus teaches man to operate in duality as his father, but he walks different, he goes on to describe a river that was cold upstream in the hills hence it quenched thirst, warm at it mouth hence good for a bath, but luke warm in the middle, if your luke warm or “ordinary” or half hearted, I shall spit thee out, so be an extremist is the parable.[init commit push]</span>
<h4>the wise guys</h4>
<p>says the Hindu, to all descriptions of the Lord of Life and Spirit. "He is not Life, but Cause that Life is.
    The guru sees intelligence in his chela (student). He does not stop to criticise the chela's stupidity. With steadfast gaze “the look” toward intelligence, like as Hufeland toward health, the guru enlarges the borders of intelligence. "Enlarge the place of thy tent," saith the voice of the Lord to Isaiah, 
    </p>
    <p>the wise man with eyes "red with wine” sees A boy in the cold is selling newspapers in ragged clothes. Whoever opens eyes red thus with inspiration to see the precious Life, soon sees the newsboy in some great University teaching the music of the spheres. Perhaps Rasta, for the parable of weed says don’t cut the weed from the wheat till maturity, then roll up the weed in bundles and burn, there's a concept of time, time is a snitch, it's not uncommon for addicts to get stuck in the year they got addicted or started to abuse as the world around them moves. Simon Magus had his eye red with wine to see the levitating principle back of the attraction of gravitation. "Lift me up," he said, ignoring all pullings earthward. And the Responsive Centrifugal lifted him into the air, he was levitating. </p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<span>So this just a book part of a larger series perhaps I didn’t it do it justice, but yet again there is growth no matter the field,isn't it persecast, after all Ecclesiastes say all is vanity like that visible smoke that chokes(touches) but can't be touched and "I am all undone," </span>
<p>for "Ruining out the handwriting of rules against us—took it out of the way, nailing it to (signing it by) the cross," wrote Paul, learned in the significance of all symbols. "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world." multum incola,</p>

<h4>Warrior of light</h4>
   <p>I've been through all this before,' he says to his heart.
'Yes, you have been through all this before,' replies his heart.
'But you have never been beyond it.'
Then the warrior realises that these repeated experiences have
but one aim: to teach him what he does not want to learn.
</p> 
<p>
A warrior of light is never predictable.
He might dance down the street on his way to work, gaze into
the eyes of a complete stranger and speak of love at first sight, or
else defend an apparently absurd idea. Warriors of light allow
themselves days like these.
</p>
<p>
He is not afraid to weep over
For the warrior, there is no 'better' or 'worse': everyone has
the necessary gifts for his particular path.
But certain people insist. They provoke and offend and do
everything they can to irritate him. At that point, his heart says:
'Do not respond to these insults, they will not increase your
abilities. You will tire yourself needlessly.'
A warrior of light does not waste his time listening to
provocations; he has a destiny to fulfil.
</p>
<p>
Every warrior of light has failed in his spiritual
duties. Every warrior of light has said 'yes' when he wanted to say
'no'. Every warrior of light has hurt someone he loved. That is
why he is a warrior of light, because he has been through all this
and yet has never lost hope of being better than he is.
</p>
<p>
The warrior always listens to the words of certain older
thinkers, such as these by T.H.Huxley:
'The consequences of our actions are the scarecrows of fools
and the beacons of wise men.'
</p>
<P>'The chess-board is the world; the pieces are the gestures of
our daily lives; the rules of the game are what we call the laws of
Nature. The player on the other side is hidden from us, but we
know that his play is always fair, just and patient.
The warrior simply has to accept the challenge. He knows that
God never overlooks a single mistake made by those he loves nor
does he allow his favourites to pretend ignorance of the rules of
the game
